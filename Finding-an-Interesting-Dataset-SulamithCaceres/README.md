# Why are you interested in this data set?
I'm interested in learning more about the qualities and factors that contribute to a song's likeliness into becoming a Spotify Hit. As an avid music listener and enjoyer, I was interested in knowing the differences between each of the songs labeled as Spotify Hits.

For this analysis, I will be using the csv file "Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019" by Mark Koverha from [this kaggle link] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019?resource=download). "This dataset contains audio statistics of the top 2000 tracks on Spotify from 2000-2019. The data contains about 18 columns each describing the track and it's qualities."
